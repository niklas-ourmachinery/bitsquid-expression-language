/// This file implements a small language for computing arithmetic expressions,
/// such as (a + b)*3 - sin(y). It allows you freedom in specifying variable
/// dependencies, while avoiding the complexities of a full blown scripting
/// language.
///
/// The language allows for constants (which are converted to numbers at compile
/// time) and variables (which are evaluated as numbers during run time).
/// The language has a fixed small set of operators and functions (more are easy
/// to add). All constants, variables and stack values used by the language are
/// 32 bit floats.
///
/// During the compilation phase, the source string is compiled to byte code
/// which is run during the run phase. The virtual machine is a simple stack-based
/// machine with the stack explicitly supplied by the caller.
///
/// All instructions in the byte code are 32-bit wide. The instruction is either
/// a regular float in which case the operation is BC_PUSH_FLOAT -- the float is
/// pushed to the stack, or it is a NaN. If the float is a NaN, the mantissa is
/// used to encode the type of operation and additional data. The first three bits
/// encode the operation and the remaining 20 bits encode the operation data.
///
/// NAN_MARKER (9) BC_PUSH_VAR (3)	id (20)		Pushes the variable with the specified id.
///	NAN_MARKER (9) BC_FUNCTION (3)	id (20)		Computes the function with the specified id.
/// NAN_MARKER (9) BC_END (3)	    zero (20)	Marks the end of the byte code.
/// float (32)									Pushes the float.

/// Flag used to include the parts of the code needed to compile to bytecode.
/// If you compile offline you can exclude this code in the runtime version.
